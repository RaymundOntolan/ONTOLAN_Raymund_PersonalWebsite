Museum which is slightly bigger than the first one. If you want to know <br>
more about the culture and ethnography of Davao City, a visit to Museo Dabawenyo <br>
shall be your first step. The museum shows the art, music, instruments, and <br>
weapons carved and made by the indigenous people of Davao City.<br>
