<h3>
   The F-16 was lighter, less expensive alternative to the F-15 Eagle. Unlike the F-15, <br>
   which is purely an air superiority fighter, the F-16 is a multi-role aircraft, capable <br>
   of attacking air and ground targets.<br><br>
   
   The F-16 has been produced in large numbers and participated in numerous conflicts. <br>
   Over 4,500 aircraft have been built. It has been widely exported and is currently <br>
   operational with 26 countries around the world. The F-16 is battle proven.<br><br>
   
   This aircraft is small, but highly maneuverable. The F-16 has a bubble single-piece <br>
   canopy for excellent pilot visibility, which becomes during close combat.<br><br>
   
   The F-16 is still in service with the US Air Force and will remain operational until 2025. <br>
   In the future it will be replaced by the new F-35 Lightning II.<br>
