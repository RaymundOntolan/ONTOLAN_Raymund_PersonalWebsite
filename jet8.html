<h3>
   The F-15 Eagle is a purpose-built air superiority fighter designed to penetrate enemy <br>
   defense. Although now in service for over 30 years, it remains a formidable warplane. <br><br>
   
   This aircraft scored more than 100 air kills and is considered among the most successful <br>
   Cold War era fighters.<br>
   The F-15 is equipped with weaponry and electronics, enabling it to detect, acquire, track <br>
   and attack enemy aircraft, while operating in enemy-controlled airspace. This fighter carries <br>
   a wide range of air-to-air missiles and is extremely maneuverable. Also it has strong high-speed <br>
   maneuverability. Through modifications and upgrades the F-15 has been constantly improved.<br><br>
   
   The F-15 Eagle is still in service with the US Air Force and is expected to remain operational <br>
   at least until 2025. This aircraft has been exported to Israel, Japan and Saudi Arabia.<br>
