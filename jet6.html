<h3>
     The Rafale is in service both with the French Air Force and Navy. This multi-role <br>
	 fighter features some of the very latest avionics systems. Also some measures <br>
	 were taken to reduce radar cross section of this aircraft. This aircraft is <br>
	 very maneuverable. <br><br>
	 
   The Rafale can track 40 targets and fire at four targets simultaneously.<br>
   This aircraft can hold its own against the latest versions of the American F-16. <br>
   The Dassault Rafale will form the cornerstone of French air power until well into <br>
   the 21st century.<br><br>
