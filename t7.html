<h3>
Does Pres. Rodrigo Duterte ring a bell? Sure he does! He is Philippine’s president, <br>
an empowering leader, admired by lots of Filipinos because of his robust and <br>
tough-talking personality and his firm principles. Before he became the President, <br>
he served as a Mayor of Davao City for seven terms.<br><br>

The President’s house is rather simple and not luxurious. As you visit his home, <br>
you will see the simplicity he has had. You can also take a tour inside and see his <br>
bed with Kulambo (mosquito net).<br><br>
