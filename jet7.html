<h3>
   The Su-35 multi-role fighter is a significantly developed version of the Su-27. <br>
   It is being offered for export as a replacement for the Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters. <br>
   In 2012 it has been adopted by the Russian Air Force.<br><br>
   
   Developers refer the Su-35 as 4++ generation fighter. It is a very fast and highly <br>
   maneuverable fighter with very long range, high altitude capability and heavy armament. <br>
   It poses great threat to Western 4+ generation fighters.<br><br>
   
   The Su-35 is primarily an air superiority fighter. However it has secondary air-to-ground <br>
   capability. This aircraft can carry enormous amount of weapons. It has 12 wing and <br>
   fuselage hardpoints and can carry ordnance with a maximum weight of up to 8 000 kg.<br><br>
   
   Its large and powerful engines give it ability to supercruise for a long time. Also its <br>
   engines allow to reach supersonic speeds without using an afterburner. Engines have a <br>
   three-dimensional thrust vectoring and make this aircraft very maneuverable.<br>
   However Russia still lags behind in the development, acquisition and employment of some <br>
   of the latest technologies.<br><br>
   
   Recently a new Sukhoi PAK FA stealthy air superiority fighter is being developed in Russia.<br>
   First operational aircraft might be delivered to the Russian air force in 2017-2018.<br><br>
