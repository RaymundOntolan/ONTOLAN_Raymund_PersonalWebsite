<h3>
The Filipino eagle is a very rare and endangered species living in the 
Davao province in Philippines.

One hour from the city proper, you will reach the Philippine Eagle <br>
Center (PEC), the home of the Grand monkey-eating eagle that can only be <br>
found in the Philippines. <br><br>

Not only you will have a close look at the great eagle, but also to other <br>
rare species such as sea eagle, hawks, along with other mammals and reptiles.<br>
The PEC is a home of 36 Philippine Eagles.<br><br>

Visiting PEC, you would have an incredible experience having to encounter <br>
these rare species. It is also a wonderful experience to visit the safe haven <br>
of these extinct animals.<br>
