<h3>
An island behind Samal is the Talicud Island. The islet is yet unknown to <br>
several travelers. But I feel obliged to tell you, Talicud Island is a place <br>
never shall you miss! One of the favorite resorts in Talicud Island is the <br>
Isla Reta, a simple resort that offers an economical stay to keep you cozy <br>
through the night. There is nothing really much to do on the Island, but you <br>
can dive the beach and enjoy the magnificent sea creatures that you will see. <br>
You will definitely enjoy snorkeling! At night, you can rent a single sleeping <br>
mattress and place it in the seashore. Forget the city lights and enjoy <br>
star-gazing the vast night sky.<br><br><br>
