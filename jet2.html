<h3>
   The F-35, also known as the Lightning II, is a new multi-role fighter. One <br>
   of its variants, the F-35B achieved initial operational capability with the <br>
   US Marine Corps in 2015.<br><br>
   
   The F-35 was developed under a Joint Strike Fighter program, which was intended <br>
   to replace existing aircraft types with a common fighter. In the near future <br>
   the F-35 will replace the AV-8B, A-10, F-16 and F/A-18warplanes in service with <br>
   the US military. Also it will be exported to a number of countries.<br><br>
   
   The F-35 has a configuration similar to that of Lockheed Martin's own F-22 design, <br>
   however it is slightly smaller and has one engine. It exploits stealth technology, <br>
   which reduces its radar cross-section and makes it harder to detect for radars<br>
   This multi-role fighter can perform on air defense missions, close air support and <br>
   tactical bombing. It is compatible with the latest air-to-air and air-to-ground <br>
   missiles.<br><br>

   This aircraft is proposed in three main variants, including the F-35A conventional <br>
   take-off and landing aircraft, F-35B short take-off and vertical landing aircraft, <br>
   and F-35C carrier-based aircraft. These variants share about 80% of their parts to keep <br>
   development and production costs low. It also requires less logistic support.<br><br>
