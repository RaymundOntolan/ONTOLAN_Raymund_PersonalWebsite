<h3>
   The F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter is almost invisible to radars. <br>
   This aircraft carries a powerful array of weaponry. It is the most advanced <br>
   and most expensive production fighter aircraft to date. Many of sensors and <br>
   avionics of this plane remain classified.<br><br>
   
   Engines of the raptor allow the aircraft to supercruise over long ranges, <br>
   while thrust-vectoring nozzles, combined with a triplex fly-by-wire flight <br>
   control system, make it exceptionally maneuverable.<br><br>
   
   The F-22 started life as a straightforward air superiority fighter. However <br>
   since its introduction this aircraft lacks a formidable air threat from other <br>
   countries fighters. Later it evolved towards the multi-role fighter, as <br>
   strike capability was added.<br><br>
   
   This advanced aircraft was never offered for export customers, even other allies <br>
   and NATO countries. Currently it is the best fighter aircraft ever built.<br><br>
