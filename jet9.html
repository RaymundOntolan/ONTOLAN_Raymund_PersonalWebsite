<h3>
  The MiG-31 (NATO designation Foxhound-A) was developed as part of an overall program <br>
  to provide the Soviet air defenses with the ability to meet the threat posed by NATO <br>
  low-level strike aircraft and cruise missiles.<br><br>
  
   This interceptor has a high speed, altitude and rate of climb, however it sacrifices <br>
   maneuverability in order to achieve these capabilities. The MiG-31 is among the fastest <br>
   production aircraft. It uses missiles to shoot-down enemy aircraft at long distances.<br><br>
   
   The latest version is the MiG-31BM; this is billed as a true multi-role Foxhound, able to <br>
   undertake long-range interception, precision strike and defense suppression tasks. Both <br>
   cockpits feature advanced displays allowing the crew to deploy precision-guided munitions. <br><br>
   
   A project to upgrade Russian interceptors to the MiG-31BM standard was begun in 2010. This <br>
   interceptor continue to form the back bone of Russia's air defenses.<br>
