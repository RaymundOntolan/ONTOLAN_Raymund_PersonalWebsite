<h3>
A quiet cove in the Island Garden of Samal, unlike other resorts Pearl Farm <br>
will give you an exclusive getaway experience without the noise of beachgoers. <br><br>

The resort offers warm accommodation. The rooms are in the contour of the <br>
island to give guests a delightful and awe-inspiring view of the horizon where <br>
the blue beach and cobalt sky meet. The resort was formerly known for cultivating <br>
pearls.<br><br>

As for today, Pearl Farm Beach Resort offers a variety of fun water sports and <br>
activities such as water polo, jet skiing, and scuba diving. A game room is also<br>
 available for sports enthusiasts who would love to play basketball, badminton, <br>
 or tennis.<br><br>
 
Pearl Farm Beach Resort offers relaxation and diversion that the city cannot provide. <br>
It is a place not only for leisure but also for getting attached to the countryside.<br>
