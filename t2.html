<h3>
Not far away from the city proper, you can visit Davao Crocodile Park, <br>
the place where you will find delight in nature and wild. This park does<br>
 not only have crocs but tigers and other variety of animals as well. <br><br>
 
 Technically, it is a zoo, but not the typical kind of zoo. The Davao <br>
 Crocodile Park also offers several shows such as tightrope walking, where <br>
 a staff will walk on a tightrope over wild crocs.<br><br>
 
After a plunge in the noisy, urban city of Davao, a visit to the Crocodile <br>
Park will take the stress away from you. The breathtaking shows along with <br>
the sight of adorable animals will entertain you and will make you love <br>
nature once again.<br><br>
