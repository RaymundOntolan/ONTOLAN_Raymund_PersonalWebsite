<h3>
In other places, nightlife is about bars, cocktails, and ladies in bikinis. <br>
But not here in Davao. The Roxas Night Market will help you define what <br>
“night life” is in Davao City. Instead of ladies in two-piece bikinis, you <br>
will see women grilling seafood and barbecues (that includes chicken intestine, <br>
chicken head, chicken feet, pork barbecue, longganiza, etc.) You can also try <br>
Mang Danny’s Ice Cream, according to the opinion of those who have tried, the <br>
dirty ice cream tastes like a gelato. You can also enjoy buying merchandises <br>
in a bargain.<br><br>

The Roxas Night Market is one of the best places in Davao where you can enjoy <br>
being one with the Dabawenyos (the people lives in Davao). The items and street <br>
food are cheap!<br><br>

Address: Roxas Ave, Poblacion District, Davao City, <br>
Davao del Sur, Philippines<br><br><br>
