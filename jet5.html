<h3>
    In 1986 the Eurofighter consortium was formed by Germany, Italy, the UK and, <br>
	later, Spain, to develop a new multi-role combat aircraft, optimized as a beyond <br>
	visual range interceptor with a secondary ground-attack capability. This aircraft <br>
	carries advanced European-designed missiles. it is fitted with a very modern <br>
	and comprehensive avionics package.<br><br>
	
    It is claimed that Typhoon is half as combat effective as the American F-22 Raptor. <br>
	It is an approximate estimate, however it seems that Typhoon is superior to the F-15F, <br>
	French Rafale, evolved Russian Su-27 variants and many other aircraft.<br><br>
	
    The Eurofighter Typhoon will form the cornerstone of European air power until well <br>
	into the 21st century.<br><br>
