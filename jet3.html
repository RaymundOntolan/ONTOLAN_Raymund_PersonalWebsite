<h3>
   The Chengdu J-20 is the new China's stealth fighter. It was designed <br>
   to compete against other fifth-generation fighters, such as the US F-22<br>
   Raptor and Russian PAK-FA. It is speculated, that development of the <br>
   J-20 was assisted by the Russian MiG aviation company. Low-rate initial<br>
   production of this stealthy aircraft commenced in 2015. First operational <br>
   J-20 stealthy fighters were delivered to Chinese air force in 2016.<br><br>
   
   During the last decade China has taken a more transparent approach to its <br>
   military programs. Still though there is little official information on this <br>
   plane.<br><br>
   
   Most likely that the new J-20 is a long-range air superiority fighter, which <br>
   might also have a secondary ground attack capability. The new Chinese warplane <br>
   might actually be an advanced forth-generation fighter, rather than a true f<br>
   ight-generation fighter.<br><br>
   
   This Chinese fighter has two large internal weapon bays for long-range air-to-air <br>
   missiles and two small side-mounted weapon bays for short-range air-to-air missiles.<br>
   Missiles are stored in these weapon bays in order to reduce the radar cross-section. <br>
   It also has large fuel tanks for long-range missions. It carries more fuel and <br>
   weapons than the American F-22 Raptor. Furthermore this aircraft is capable of <br>
   high speed operations.<br><br>
